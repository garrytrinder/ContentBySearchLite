# ContentBySearchLite

Sample code from presentation made by Garry Trinder at SharePoint User Group (SUGUK) Nottingham on Thursday 30th April 2015 at Strelley Hall, Nottingham.

ContentBySearchLite is a jQuery plugin that aims to recreate the functionality of the Content By Search Web Part that comes with SharePoint 2013 Enterprise using Search REST API to pull data from SharePoint and use Handlebars templates to render the results easily.

The code is wrapped in a Sandbox solution* at the moment for ease of deployment to a Site Collection, once deployed activate the web part to the Web Part Gallery by activating the ContentBySearch Lite Site Collection feature.

\*I know, Sandbox solutions are deprecated but this was a nice easy "supportable" way to deploy from the client :)
